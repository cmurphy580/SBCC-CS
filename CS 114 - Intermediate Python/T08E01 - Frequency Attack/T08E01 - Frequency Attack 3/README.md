##The program is invoked from the command line using the following syntax:

'''
frequency -f frequency.csv ciphertext.txt
'''

###The file frequency.csv is a list of the frequency distribution of all the words in the cleartext. This is basically a more directed version of the frequency of words in the English language. The file ciphertext.txt is the cipher text that you need to decrypt.

###The output will look like the following:

'''
Letter    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
          --------------------------
Predicted JKBXQVYLH!EIOSPZ!CWDAMRNT!
'''

##Cleartext
###Following the word Cleartext will be the cleartext generated by decrypting the ciphertext.txt file. You can cut and paste that into Google to figure out which book the cleartext originates.
